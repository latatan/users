 WARNMING :
 1. Why is there a version option on setting : It will make the program compare the versions.
 Fix -- If you change the version on this json file. When the program starts it will get error.
 The system will notify you, when your script is not the lastest.
 
 2. Notification : Notification will show-up only when you execute. it will notify you to update your versions.
 Fix -- If you don't want it. Just unenable the boolean. (True, False)
 
 3. Colors : primary_color (banner), system_color (notifications + message from server), entry_color (User Input , Command Bar)
      list : dark_grey, bright_red, bright_green, yellow, bright_blue, bright_magenta, bright_cyan, white
